Following the expiration of the applicable **_License Term_**, you may no longer deploy new units of **_Application(s)_** incorporating the **_Software_**.  Unless otherwise expressly prohibited by this **_Agreement_**, however, your **_Customer(s)_** continue to have the right to use **_Application(s)_** incorporating the **_Software_** supplied to them prior to the expiration of the related **_License Term_**.  Any use of the **_Software_** beyond the scope of this **_Agreement_** or any **_Purchase Order_** is subject to payment of additional **_License fees_**.

c. *Licensing Models.*

i. *In General.*  The **_Software_** includes the **_SDK_** and may include **_Add-on Modules_** and **_Broker™_**, if applicable.  Your **_License_** requirements will be determined by the number of your **_Developers_**, the number of **_Installed Instances_** or whether the **_Application(s)_** are installed in a single **_Location_** or multiple **_Locations_**.  The purchase price(s) for your **_License_** to the **_Software_** are specified on a **_Purchase Order_**.

**5. LIMITATION ON YOUR USE.**

a. *Restrictions on Use.*  You may not (and you may not permit anyone else, on your behalf or otherwise to) copy, disassemble, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the **_Software_** or any part thereof.

b. *Compliance with Laws.*  You agree to use the **_Software_** only for purposes, and in a manner, permitted by (i) this **_Agreement_** and (ii) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions including, without limitation, any regulations of the United States Bureau of Export Administration and other applicable governmental agencies (including all applicable US export restrictions).

c. *Restrictions on Sublicense or Assignment.*  This **_Agreement_** and any **_License_** granted under this **_Agreement_** are personal to you, and do not include the right to sublicense your rights under this **_Agreement_** to any third party.  You may not transfer or assign, by operation of law or otherwise, this **_Agreement_** or your **_License_** to any third party without our prior written consent, which may be withheld in our sole discretion for any reason or no reason.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may permit your employees, consultants or other third-party service providers (collectively, **_“Personnel”_**) to access and use the **_Software_** on your behalf; provided that you shall be responsible for ensuring that your **_Personnel_** comply with this **_Agreement_** and any applicable end user license agreement or terms and conditions to which they assent.  If you acquire a third party entity or acquire substantially all the assets or equity of a third party entity, or are acquired by a third party, in each case, whether by merger, change in control, sales of assets, consolidation or otherwise, such event shall be considered an assignment of this **_Agreement_** for this purpose.  Any assignment or attempted assignment in violation of this **_Agreement_** shall be of no effect, and shall constitute a breach of this **_Agreement_** and result in the immediate and automatic termination of your license rights under this **_Agreement_**; any renewal of such rights shall, if then available, be at our sole discretion, and will be on terms and conditions applicable at the time of such renewal.  You may not create a library that exposes or wraps functionality of the **_Software_** to a non-licensed party.

d. *Additional Restrictions.*

i. *Maximum Number of Applications per License.*   Your **_License_** permits you to incorporate our **_Software_** into **_Applications_** you build.  Your **_Purchase Order(s)_** may specify the maximum number of **_Applications_** you may build with a single **_License_**.

**6. SUBSEQUENT OR PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF THE SOFTWARE; MULTIPLE PHYSICAL COPIES.**

a. *Future Versions.*  The **_License_** granted to you under this **_Agreement_** is for the current version of the **_Software_** as of the time we make such version available to you under this **_Agreement_**.  We may release future versions of the **_Software_** under this **_Agreement_** or a different agreement.  Nothing in this **_Agreement_** is a commitment to you of compatibility between the **_Software_** and any future versions of the **_Software_**. This **_Agreement_** shall apply to any such updated **_Software_** made available to you except as otherwise expressly agreed in connection with such updated **_Software_**.

b. *Upgrades of Previous Versions.*  If the **_Software_** provided to you is an upgrade or revised version of the **_Software_** previously provided to you under this **_Agreement_** or a predecessor agreement, you may not loan, rent, lease or otherwise transfer the original non-upgraded **_Software_** to another user or a separate computer.  If the **_Software_** is an upgrade of a component of a package of software programs that you licensed as a single product, the **_Software_** may be used and transferred only as part of that single product package and may not be separated for use by another user or on a separate computer.

c. *Multiple Physical Copies.*  You may receive the **_Software_** in more than one medium.  Receipt of more than one copy of the **_Software_** (either on physical media or by multiple downloads or otherwise) does not entitle you to any additional rights to the **_Software_**.  Your rights to use the **_Software_** derive from this **_Agreement_** and the **_License_** related hereto, not from any rights to ownership of tangible media, which if provided is only provided for your convenience. 

**7. SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS.**  The following provisions set forth your rights concerning maintenance and support of the **_Software_**.  Any such services are provided only during the **_License Term_**.

   iii. *Problem and Error Resolution.*  We will investigate all potential errors related to the **_Software’s_** nonconformance to any documentation we provide, so long as you have notified us in writing (including via email and via submission to a support site or portal we make available to you) during the **_License Term_**.  We will make commercially reasonable attempts to substantiate the existence of the problem or error, evaluate the seriousness of the problem’s effect on you and provide a workaround or resolution within the time frame established in the **_Error Reporting and Priority Guidelines_**.  This does not guarantee that the resolution will include an update to the **_Software_** that will resolve or fix the reported issue.

   iv. *Telephone Consultation.*  We will provide reasonable telephone consultation to assist in the implementation and utilization of the **_Software_** during our **_Standard Support Hours_**.

   iv. *Response Time.*  We shall, after receipt and classification, use commercially reasonable efforts to respond during **_Standard Support Hours_** to each notification as indicated below, with a resolution of the issue as indicated below:

c. *General Indemnification Terms.*  The indemnifying party will defend at its expense any action described in this indemnification section brought against any indemnified party and will pay any costs and damages finally awarded against the indemnified party in such action or in settlement of such claim; provided that the indemnified party shall not be required to pay any settlement to which it has not consented, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  As a condition to receiving any such indemnification, the indemnified party must promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing of such claim and permit the indemnifying party to control the defense of any such claim, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

**15. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF ALLOCATION OF RISK.**  The **_Software_** provided to you hereunder is to be incorporated by you into **_Applications_** over which we have no control, provided to **_Customers_** we have no right to evaluate, and with whom we have no right to communicate or negotiate.  You, and not we, therefore, have essential control over the circumstances that will enable you to assess and mitigate risk associated with the use of the **_Software_**.  The provisions of this **_Agreement_** are designed to allocate risk consistent with these realities.  You accordingly acknowledge that you understand that an essential purpose of the exclusion of warranties, the indemnification and limitation of liability provided in this **_Agreement_** is allocation of risks between both of us, which allocation of risks is reflected in the applicable fees and other arrangements between both of us in the **_Agreement_**, and that we would not be willing to enter into this **_Agreement_** with you and license the **_Software_** to you if we were required to bear any additional risk.
